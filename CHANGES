Spacewar Change Log

Version 0.2
Integrated original spacewar game into the SolarWolf game framework.
Now we have sound effects, background music, main menu, credits, 
setup menu, in game side-bar game with score for each player,
select 1-4 players from setup menu. The spacewar logo is now much 
better looking, the "sun" is now a spinning box which fits better 
with the menu screen and startup. I changed the startup sound to be
the explosion instead of the howl. The main screen specifies how many
players is currently selected under the start button.


Version 0.1
Initial release. Two players, fixed key controls, gravity, spiked ball
in the middle. Animated spiked ball, ships, blaster, explosion.
Simple scoring. Start up screen logo.
