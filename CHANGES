Spacewar Change Log


Version 0.5
Preference to change graphics level to remove smoke and/or
stars. No sun and blackhole "sun" option. Transparent shields.
1 player tutorial mode. F1 brings up key control list. Overall
game stats: time, kills, and deaths. The ship with the most shield 
and health strength now survives in a ship to ship collision.
Help text referring to F1 help will appear if player hits 
non-functional keys several times in a row. Moved more object logic
into the Mass class. Super bullets. Sorted preferences. Simple 
computer players.
4548 lines of code.


Version 0.4
Fixed news download bug. Moved most objects processing code from
gameplay.py to objs.py. Created a stand alone object only test mode 
(./objs.py). Insults and complements. Shields and shield bar on the 
HUD. Powerup bobbles now appear which give shield strength.  Made a 
nice background image for health and shield bar. Shield protects 
against explosion. Fire damage now fades over life of fire.  Win at 
a certain score. A bunch of new preferences. Fixed rendering bug.
4320 lines of code.


Version 0.3
Health bar. Health bar gradually recharges. Health bar re-charge shows
how much time until re-appearance. Fire/bullets and explosions simply
take away health instead of instant death.
4211 lines of code.


Version 0.2
Integrated original spacewar game into the SolarWolf game framework.
Now we have sound effects, background music, main menu, credits, 
setup menu, in game side-bar game with score for each player,
select 1-4 players from setup menu. The spacewar logo is now much 
better looking, the "sun" is now a spinning box which fits better 
with the menu screen and startup. I changed the startup sound to be
the explosion instead of the howl. The main screen specifies how many
players is currently selected under the start button.
4387 lines of code.


Version 0.1
