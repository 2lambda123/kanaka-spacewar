Spacewar Change Log


Version 0.4
Fixed news download bug. Moved most objects processing code from
gameplay.py to objs.py. Created a stand alone object only test mode 
(./objs.py). Insults and complements. Added shields and shield bar
on the HUD. Powerup bobbles now appear which give shield strength. 
Made a nice background image for health and shield bar. Shield 
protects against explosion. Fire damage now fades over life of fire. 
Added win at a certain score. Added a bunch of preferences. Fix 
rendering bug.
4320 lines of code.


Version 0.3
Health bar. Health bar gradually recharges. Health bar re-charge shows
how much time until re-appearance. Fire/bullets and explosions simply
take away health instead of instant death.
4211 lines of code.


Version 0.2
Integrated original spacewar game into the SolarWolf game framework.
Now we have sound effects, background music, main menu, credits, 
setup menu, in game side-bar game with score for each player,
select 1-4 players from setup menu. The spacewar logo is now much 
better looking, the "sun" is now a spinning box which fits better 
with the menu screen and startup. I changed the startup sound to be
the explosion instead of the howl. The main screen specifies how many
players is currently selected under the start button.
4387 lines of code.


Version 0.1
Initial release. Two players, fixed key controls, gravity, spiked ball
in the middle. Animated spiked ball, ships, blaster, explosion.
Simple scoring. Start up screen logo.
453 lines of code.
