Spacewar TODO list

Short term:
    - Better shield graphics/transparent
    - Create Windows executable and test
    - Better insult and complement determination

Medium term:
    - teleport in ships after death, not just start
        - develop colorless teleport images
    - Better sorting order for preferences
    - Give on screen help if players don't appear to know the keys

Long term:
    - Make menu spinning box transparent around edges
    - network play
    - Option for floating health and shield bar above ship
    - import preferences file instead of parsing it
    - possibly scale everything down, pygame.transform.scale
