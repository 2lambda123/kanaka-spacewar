      - Ships and Score

Medium term:
    - Create Windows executable and test
    - Make menu spinning box transparent around edges
    - Get news download working
    - Better health
        - Create nice image for health container
        - Option for amount of health and recharge rate
    - Add shields gotten from powerup
        - Perhaps powerup triggered by number of kills in a row, and 
          weighted to appear near ship of "killer"
    - teleport in ships after death, not just start
        - develop colorless teleport images

Long term:
    - Option for floating health and shield bar above ship
    - Give on screen help if players don't appear to know the keys
    - import preferences file instead of parsing it
    - possibly scale everything down, pygame.transform.scale

        - Add prefs class to game.py
        - Add a value to each preference, simplify number of players
    - Move runobjects into objs
    - Move hud into objs
    - Make objs runable by itself with default values and no stars, etc
