AI Notes 

- Genetic algorithm to generate computer players
  - separate standalone module to run GA generations
    - Loads generations from a file
    - Changes draw and erase routines to very low overhead or none
    - Remove frame rate limiter
    - Saves generations back to a file
    - Latches user exit routine and saves back to file


- DNA structure
    - Base - a condition with 5 components
        .comparison: none,rand_num,dist_dist,dist_num,dir_dir,dir_num
        .future1: 40 items (0-85)
        .future2: 40 items (0-85)
        .value: 0-40 (distances 0 -> 800, and directions 21 -> -19
        .operator: '==', '>', '<'
    - Gene - a stimulus->response entry
        .type: significant, hard, damage, ship, sun, fire, spike, 
                asteroid, shield, bullet, powerup
        .base: (6 bases)
        .action: none, fire, thrust, rthrust, left, right
    - DNA - list of genes in priority order
        .gene: (list of genes in priority order)


Meaning of future1,future2,value, and operator for each comparison
        none      : Nothing
        rand_num  : <rand> operator value
        dist_dist : <dist * future1> operator <dist * future2 + value>
        dist_num  : <dist * future1> operator value
        dir_dir   : <dir * future1> operator <dir * future2 + value>
        dir_num   : <dir * future1> operator value

 Format of data file:
         Number of DNA's (different AI's)
           Number of Genes in DNA
             Type of gene
             Number of Bases
             Base per line (comma seperated list):
               comparison,future1,future2,value,operator
             Action
