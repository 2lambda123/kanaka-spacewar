Spacewar Ideas

Basic Rules:

    Two ships on a looping "toroid" plane. Each ship has a thruster
    that accelerates the ship in the direction it is facing. Each ship
    can rotate. Each ship also has a blaster that fires bullets at
    a limited rate that live for a limited amount of time. Bullets
    move at their default velocity adjusted by the velocity of the
    ship when fired. There is also a sun in the center of the plane
    that constantly accelerates the ships towards itself. Ships are
    destroyed if they collide with a bullet, the sun, or another ship.
    Game is time limited and players score a point when other player
    dies.


Alternate rules:
    Space plane
    - Normal: Toroid looping of ships and bullets
    - Border instead of looping. Collision with border is death.
    - Alternate looping models: opposite edge, random, etc.

    Sun/Blackhole
    - Multiple suns.
    - Alternate positioning of sun(s)/blackhole(s).
    - Repulsion instead of atraction.
    * Without or without a sun.
    * Varying amounts of gravity for the sun
    * Blackhole(s) instead of sun. Invisible, but with same affect.
    * Suns or blackholes are not fixed location and have a starting
      velocity and or are affected by other gravitational objects.

    Ships
    - Ships have ability to warp. No limit on warps or warps accumulate
      at a certain rate with a cap.
    - AI controlled ships with varying intelligence.
    - Ships have varying amount of gravitational pull/repulsion.
    - Amount of effect that thrusters apply.
    - Varying size ship compared to size of plane.
    - Ships may have different properties for each player chosen at
      the beginning. Chosing ship properties is a trade off with other
      properties (blaster rate, thruster power, warp cap, warp
      accumulation rate, shield strenth, shield accumulation rate).
    * Ships have shields. Events that normally cause death would
      decrease shield strength. Shields could restore at a certain
      rate. Shields strength would have a cap. Different "death"
      events could have different effect on shields.
    * Likewise, ships might have health.
    * 2 to 4 ships. With more than 2 ships, score is for killing
      another ship.  "Suicide" death results in score subtraction.

    Weapons
    - Affected or not by gravity.
    - Varying default velocity.
    - Varying amount of time that bullets stay alive.
    - Different types of "bullets". Different amount of damage, rate
      of fire, ability to loop, affect by gravity, affect on
      shields/health.
      * Blaster: medium velocity, medium but equal affect on
        health/shields, low affect by gravity.
      - Phaser: high velocity, low affect on shields, high on health,
        not affected by gravity, does not wrap.
        Plasma: medium-high velocity, high affect on shields, low on
        health, does not wrap.
      - Bomb: slow or no velocity, high damage to shields and health,
        highly affected by gravity.
    * Limits: firing rate limit, limit on number that ship can have
      active simultaneously.

    Objects
    - Good objects. 
      - Health and shield powerups
      - Boost health cap. Ammunition. Warps. Automatic warp.
    - Bad objects. 
      * Spiked balls.
      - Asteroids that can be collided with.
